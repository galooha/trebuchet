      "message": "This is something to discuss/address after this CL, but I don\u0027t really love the MissingSliceException. This one seems to be used when you try to search for something and that thing is not found. This sounds like normal, expected behavior, and not something exceptional. But, this also depends on general philosophies of error handling.\n\nAlthough, given that we also have the OrNull versions of most of the search functions, having this exception makes sense for the ones that promise not to return null.",
